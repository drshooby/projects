Hello! This folder contains my semester-long project for Software Development (CS272). While it was challenging, it was very fun to work on.

_____

The project is an ethical web-crawler designed to crawl the dvc.edu website with respect to their robots.txt and sitemap.

Please feel free to take a look at the different files. I had an opportunity to learn Go, databases with SQLite3, and brush up on HTML and CSS.
