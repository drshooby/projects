Hello! This folder contains a Huffman Table Generator with a text Encoder and Decoder.

| File | Instruction |
| --- | --- |
| Generate | compile and run with no arguments, however, you need a training file (I use trainer.txt but I marked where to change the file name in the code) and it should create a file called "codebook" |
| Encode | compile and run with 2 arguments: An input file (with the text you want to encode) and a file to write the encoded text to |
| Decode | Decode: compile and run with 2 arguments: The encoded file from Encode and a file to write the decoded text to |
